Accelerating Multiplication and Parallelizing Operaitions in Non-Volatile Memory

BACKGRAOUD:
IoT application to run machine learning algorithms.

PROBLEM:
- cloud: not scalable and not real-time response.
- local (traditional core): high energy consumption and slow processing speed, because of memory/cache bottleneck.

SOLUTION: 
Approximate processing in-memory architecture (APIM), based on non-volatile ReRAM( Resistive RAM)
- APIM
  - Architecture
     - blocked memory structure
     - data block and processing block interchangeably
     - configurable interconnects
  - Multiplication having three stages
     - partial product generation (partial N * N)
     - fast addition (reduce N to 2)
     - final product generation 
  - Approximation: sacrafice accuracy for higher speed
- ReRAM
  - Non-volatile (resistive)
  - low latency 100ns ( DRAM 10ns, NAND_SLC/TLC 100us)
  - Meet the need of neuromorphic computing, which is analog

EVALUATION:
- Plaform
  - circuit level siulation with Cadence Virtuoso
- Target
  - addition of N operands of length N bits
- Result (Exact APIM)
  - dataset > 200MB
    APIM is much faster and more energy efficient than GPU
  - dataset > 1GB
    APIM is 28* energy savings, 4.8* performance improvement
